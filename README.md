## Overview
This project focuses on real-time **Ather Electric Scooter Detection** using **YOLOv8**, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for object detection. The system is designed to process live webcam feed, detect Ather scooters, and display bounding boxes along with confidence scores.

## Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Uses a webcam to detect Ather scooters in real-time.
- **High Accuracy**: Trained on a curated dataset using **YOLOv8** for precise detection.
- **Optimized Performance**: Utilizes **OpenCV** and **PyTorch** for efficient processing.
- **Custom Dataset Integration**: Downloads a custom dataset from **Roboflow** for training.
- **Scalability**: Can be extended to detect other vehicle types or integrated into broader surveillance systems.

## Dependencies
Ensure your system has the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python roboflow torch torchvision torchaudio numpy
```
If you face any installation issues, ensure that you are using **Python 3.8+** and a **GPU-enabled system** (for better performance).

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nikhil-cp1905/Ather-YOLOv8-Detection.git
cd Ather-YOLOv8-Detection
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
_(Alternatively, install dependencies manually as mentioned above.)_

### 3. Download the Dataset
```python
from roboflow import Roboflow

rf = Roboflow(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")  # Replace with your API key
project = rf.workspace("jarivs").project("ather-hy9he")
version = project.version(3)
dataset = version.download("yolov8")
```

### 4. Place the Model File
Ensure `best.pt` (trained YOLOv8 model) is in the project directory. If you need to train a model, refer to the **Training Instructions** below.

### 5. Run the Detection Script
```bash
python detect.py
```

## Usage Instructions
- The program starts the default webcam and begins real-time scooter detection.
- Bounding boxes are drawn around detected scooters along with confidence scores.
- Press **'q'** to exit the application.

## File Structure
```
Ather-YOLOv8-Detection/
â”‚â”€â”€ best.pt               # Trained YOLOv8 model
â”‚â”€â”€ detect.py             # Main script for real-time detection
â”‚â”€â”€ dataset/              # Contains dataset (after download)
â”‚â”€â”€ requirements.txt      # Dependencies
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md             # Project documentation
```

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Dataset is sourced from **Roboflow** and annotated with bounding boxes for Ather scooters.
   - Images are preprocessed for optimal input to the YOLOv8 model.

2. **Model Training**
   - The YOLOv8 model is trained on the collected dataset with customized hyperparameters.
   - Trained weights are saved in `best.pt`.

3. **Real-Time Detection**
   - The trained model processes frames from the webcam.
   - Bounding boxes are drawn for detected scooters.

## Performance Metrics
- **Mean Average Precision (mAP)**: Achieved **~90%** accuracy in detecting Ather scooters.
- **Inference Speed**: Processes **30+ FPS** on a GPU-powered system.
- **False Positives**: Minimal false positives due to high-quality dataset.

## Future Improvements
- **Edge Device Optimization**: Porting the model to work on **Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano**.
- **Multiple Object Detection**: Expanding the dataset to include **other vehicle types**.
- **Improved Speed**: Implementing **TensorRT acceleration** for real-time detection.
